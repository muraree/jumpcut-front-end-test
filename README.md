JUMPCUT-FRONT-END-TEST PART-1

Overview:

The task basically consists of Front-End made on React. The reason why i used React for the test is because of its state management which stores the initial states and the incoming state which can be provided when needed to the component and to other component as well using props. This helps the user to work on any high-end feature with ease.

I was able to divide the task into small components which is best suited for scalability. For more scalable architecture React is used with Redux but for simple tasks using React is ok. It is a SPA library which provides all data without refreshing the page. It is also one of the popular trend used in present front-end development.    

Front-End Work:

* Used React.js for front-end task.
* Made seperate directory for components.
* Made seperate directory for each component having index.js file in it.

Instructions for Running Task:

* Clone the repo first.
* Run `npm i` inside the project directory to install the node_modules essential for running the project.
* Now run `npm start` inside the project directory to run the project.
